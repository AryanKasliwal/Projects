bug report - Reader class is throwing file errors for menu and location
Issue was that Restraunt class did not implement addFood method properly and Reader was searching for wrong file and reader used .next() instead of nextLine() because full line was needed

tickmins bug *Utkarsh*
order of operations was wrong
hour was being wronly incremeted due to double adding tick

tick mins and hours mod issue *Utkarsh*
opperator precendance issue, mod was happening before addition instead of after, giving incorrect result

location class calcccurrentcapcacity *Utkarsh*
was giving free seats instead of occupied seats (due to implementation result needed to be inverted)

reading scanner bug
-input was stuck in inf loop for reading food options

Clock Iterator *Utkarsh*
iternator.next was called twice casuing a double tick getinterval function


clock Iterator 1 *Utkarsh*, 
is missing the first value, fixed by manually adding the first value

Clock Iterator 2 *utkarsh*, 
Due to comparision logic error, garbarbage intervals were being recorded,

Clock Iterator 3 *Utkarsh*, 
last set of hashmap wasn't being checked. Added a manual if check for it
Originally to fix the third bug, second bug was found

Clock Iterator 4 *Utkarsh*,
Fixed the root cause ie. clock's iterator by returning initial value of clock

string format in bill was using floats but being passed int instead in showbill fixed by changing to int

clock iterator was using the system clock to tick instead of a clone so the system time would be set to 11pm after 1 reservation was made. solved by cloning system clock instead


fixed issue where ExInvalidClockrange would show mins<0 with a single 0 instead of 09;
